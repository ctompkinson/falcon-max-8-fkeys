A preconfigured firmware for the Falcon Max 8 to configure it to use F13-F20 keys

The current firmware configuration tool doesn't let you use keys not on the keyboard.

This firmware has been manually updated to include the keys F13-F20 so that every key
on the macro pad can be one not used by your keyboard.

To install the firmware move the jumper and copy the firmware to the mounted drive.
